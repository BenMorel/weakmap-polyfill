     *
     * The difference between the native PHP 8 implementation and the polyfill is when memory is reclaimed: with the
     * native WeakMap, the memory used by the data attached to an object is reclaimed as soon as the object is
     * destroyed. With the polyfill, the memory is reclaimed only when new operations are performed on the WeakMap:
     *
     * - count() will reclaim memory immediately
     * - offsetX() methods will reclaim memory every 100 calls
     *
     * This is a reasonable trade-off between performance and memory usage, but keep in mind that the polyfill will
     * always be slower, and consume more memory, than the native implementation.
